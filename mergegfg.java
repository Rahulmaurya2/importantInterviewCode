//Merge Without Extra Space
/*Given two sorted arrays arr1[] and arr2[] of sizes n and m in non-decreasing order. Merge them in sorted order without using any extra space. Modify arr1 so that it contains the first N elements and modify arr2 so that it contains the last M elements.
 

Example 1:

Input: 
n = 4, arr1[] = [1 3 5 7] 
m = 5, arr2[] = [0 2 6 8 9]
Output: 
arr1[] = [0 1 2 3]
arr2[] = [5 6 7 8 9]
Explanation:
After merging the two 
non-decreasing arrays, we get, 
0 1 2 3 5 6 7 8 9.*/


//solution:

class Solution
{
    public static void merge(long arr1[], long arr2[], int n, int m) 
    {
      int i = 0;
      long temp = 0;
 
        while (arr1[n - 1] > arr2[0]) {
            if (arr1[i] > arr2[0]) {
                temp = arr1[i];
                arr1[i] = arr2[0];
                arr2[0] = temp;
                Arrays.sort(arr2);
            }
            i++;
        }
    }
}
